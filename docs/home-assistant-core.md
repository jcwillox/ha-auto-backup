# Home Assistant Core

To use Auto Backup on Home Assistant Core you will need to have the [`backup`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/backup) integration loaded, if you are already using [`default_config`](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/default_config) (enabled by default) then this will already be loaded.

!!! note

    The `addons` and `folders` options will have no effect for Home Assistant Core users, as addons and extra folders such as `ssl` and `share` only exist in Home Assistant OS and Supervised installations.
